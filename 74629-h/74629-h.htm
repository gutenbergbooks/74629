<p class="dropcap">We, the Freeholders of the County of Devon,
assembled in a General Meeting at the Castle of
Exon, find ourselves called upon by many weighty considerations
to exercise the constitutional and unquestionable
right of instructing our Members with regard to
their conduct in Parliament. It becomes now more
highly necessary, when an opinion has been publickly
avowed, derogatory from that relation which ought to
subsist between the Electors and their Representatives.
We, therefore, enjoin you to promote and support an
enquiry into all those grievances that have so justly
alarmed the subjects of this kingdom; particularly, for
what reasons a magistrate, in the immediate service of the
Crown, to whom informations of the most important nature
were imparted by a native and Freeholder of this
County, refused to examine or enquire after the evidence
pointed out to him; being a person the most capable of
clearing up the affair, both from his own knowledge, and
the papers <i>then</i> in his possession; in consequence of which
refusal, secrets of the most important nature to the safety
of this kingdom have been probably lost, and the alledged
instruments of dishonour to his Majesty’s government
<i>screen’d</i> from censure and punishment; and that you will
diligently pursue an enquiry into the criminal transactions
referred to in that information; and that you also use
your utmost endeavours to shorten the duration of Parliaments.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap gesperrt">Gentlemen</span>,</p>

<p class="dropcap">The sheriff having summoned a
meeting of the county in order to
consider of a Petition for redress of grievances,
I think it incumbent on me as a
lover of my country in general to lay before
you a transaction, which, I apprehend, gives
juster grounds of complaint and apprehension
than any thing hitherto made public. Having
long had reason to imagine that the nation
has been cruelly and fatally injured in a way
which they little suspect, I have ardently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
wished for the day, when my imperfect information
should be superseded by evidence
and certainty. That day, I flatter myself,
is at last approaching, and that the spirit
which now appears among the Freeholders
will bear down every obstacle that may be
thrown in the way of open and impartial
enquiry.</p>

<p>I need not remind you, Gentlemen, of the
universal indignation and abhorrence, with
which the conditions of the late peace were
received by the independant part of the nation.
Yet such is the candid, unsuspecting
nature of Englishmen, that even those who
condemned the measure did not attribute it
to any worse motive than an unmanly impatience
under the burdens of the war, and a
blind, headlong desire to be relieved from
them. They did not conceive that persons
of high rank and unbounded wealth could be
seduced by gold to betray the interests of their
country, and surrender advantages, which the
lives of so many heroes had been willingly
sacrificed to purchase. Such a supposition,
unhappily for us, is at present far from incredible.
The important secret was disclosed
to me in the year 1764, during my residence
at Paris. I will not trouble you with a detail
of the intermediate steps I took in the affair,
which, however, in proper time I shall
most fully and readily discover. It is sufficient
to say, on the 10th of May 1765, by
the direction of Dr. Blackstone I waited on
Lord Halifax, then Secretary of State, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
delivered to him an exact narrative of the intelligence
I had received at Paris, with copies
of four letters to and from Lord Hertford.
The behaviour of Lord Halifax was polite
but evasive. When I pressed him in a second
interview to enquire into the truth of the
charge, he objected to all public steps that
might give an alarm, and asked me whether
I could point out to him any way of prosecuting
the enquiry in secret, and whether in
so doing there was any probability of his obtaining
positive proof of the fact. I was not
so much the dupe of his artifice as to believe
that he had any serious intention of following
the clue I had given him, though his discourse
plainly pointed that way. It appeared
by the sequel that I had judged right. For
having four days after given a direct and satisfactory
answer to both his questions, he then
put an end to my solicitations by a peremptory
refusal to take any steps whatever in the
affair.</p>

<p>It is here necessary to explain what I mean
by enquiring into the truth of the charge.
In the summer of the year 1764, an overture
had been made to Sir George Yonge, Mr.
Fitzherbert, and several other Members of
Parliament, in the name of the Chevalier
D’Eon, importing that he, the Chevalier,
was ready to impeach three persons, two of
whom are Peers and Members of the Privy
Council, of selling the peace to the French.
Of this proposal I was informed at different
times by the two gentlemen above-mentioned.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
Sir George Yonge in particular told me that
he understood the charge could be supported
by written as well as living evidence. The
step that I urged Lord Halifax to take, was
to send for the Chevalier D’Eon, to examine
him upon the subject of this overture, to peruse
his papers, and then to proceed according
to the proofs. In such a case a more decisive
evidence than the Chevalier D’Eon
could not be wished for. He had the negociation
on the part of the enemy, and was
known to have in his possession the dispatches
and papers of the Duke de Nivernois. This
gentleman, so qualified and so disposed to give
light into the affair, did Lord Halifax refuse
to examine; whether from an apprehension
that the charge would not be made out, or
on the contrary that it could. I leave you,
gentlemen, and every impartial reader to
judge.</p>

<p>It must not be understood, that I can myself
support a charge of corruption against the
noble Lords named in my information. My
complaint is of a different nature and against
a different person. I consider the refusal of
Lord Halifax as a willful obstruction of national
justice, for which I wish to see him undergo
a suitable punishment. Permit me to
observe, gentlemen, that such an obstruction
not only gives a temporary impunity to offenders,
but tends also to make that impunity
perpetual, by destroying or weakening
the proofs of their guilt. Evidence of all
kinds is a very perishable thing. Living<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
witnesses are exposed to the chance of mortality,
and written evidence to the not uncommon
casualty of fire. In the present case something
more than these ordinary accidents
might with good reason be apprehended. It
stands upon record that the Count de Guerchy
had conspired to assassinate the Chevalier
D’Eon, neither has this charge hitherto been
refuted or answered. This not succeeding, a
band of ruffians was hired to kidnap that gentleman,
and carry off his papers. Though
this second attempt failed, it does not follow
that these important papers are still secure. I
was informed by Mr. Fitzherbert, so long ago
as the 17th of May, 1765, that he had then
intelligence of overtures making to the Chevalier
D’Eon, the object of which was to get
the papers out of his hands in return for a
stipulated sum of money. This account I
communicated the following day to Lord
Halifax, who still persisted in exposing those
precious documents to so many complicated
hazards. I say precious documents, because
if they should be unfortunately lost, the affair
must be for ever involved in uncertainty, an
uncertainty, gentlemen, which may be productive
of infinite mischiefs to the nation, and
cannot tend to the advantage or satisfaction
of any but the guilty.</p>

<p>Lord Halifax, in excuse for his refusal, will
probably alledge, as he did to me, his persuasion
that the charge was wholly groundless.
I need not observe, how misplaced and frivolous
such an allegation is when applied to justify<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
a magistrate for not examining evidence.
But I will suppose for argument’s sake the
persons accused to be perfectly innocent. Is it
not the interest and the wish of every innocent
man to have his conduct scrutinized while
facts are recent, and truth, of consequence, easy
to be distinguished from falshood? Is there
any tenderness in suffering a stain to remain
upon their characters till it becomes difficult,
or even impossible to be wiped out? Will therefore
these noble persons, if their actions have
been upright, will they, I say, thank Lord
Halifax for depriving them of an early opportunity
of establishing their innocence? Will they
not regret and execrate his caution, if the subsequent
suppression or destruction of the evidence
should concur with other circumstances
to fix on them the suspicion of guilt? How
will Lord Halifax excuse himself to his Sovereign,
for suffering so attrocious a calumny
to spread and take root, to the evident hazard
of his royal reputation? And what amends will
he make to the nation for the heart burnings and
jealousies which are the natural fruits of such
a procedure? Yet these, gentlemen, are the
least of the mischiefs that may be apprehended
from his behaviour upon the footing
of his own plea.</p>

<p>I will venture however to assert, that, as
far as hitherto appears, the weight of evidence
and probability is on the contrary side.
Now, supposing the charge to be true, there
can be no need of long arguments to convince
you of the injury done to the nation, by suffering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
such capital offenders to escape. For
what is this but to defraud us of the only
compensation we can expect for the loss of
so many important territories, a loss rendered
still more grievous by the indignity of paying
a pension, as we notoriously do, to the foreign
ministers who negociated the ruinous
bargain? Yet even these considerations are
infinitely out-weighed by the danger to which
the whole nation must be exposed from the
continued operation of so much authority, influence,
and favour to their prejudice, and,
above all, from the possibility that the supreme
government of the kingdom may, by
the regency-act, devolve to a person directly
and positively accused of high treason. Even
the encouragement that such an impunity
must give to future treasons, is enough to fill
a thinking mind with the most painful apprehensions.
We live in an age, not greatly
addicted to scruples, when the open avowal
of domestic venality seems to lead men, by
an easy gradation, to connexions equally
mercenary with foreigners and enemies. How
then can we expect ill-disposed persons to resist
a temptation of this sort, when they find
that treason may be detected, and proofs of
it offered to a magistrate, without producing
either punishment or enquiry? The consequence
of this may be, our living to see a
French party, as well as a court party, in
parliament; which, should it ever happen,
no imagination can sufficiently paint the calamitous
and horrid state to which our late<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
glorious triumphs might finally be reduced.
When I talk of a French party in parliament,
I do not speak a mere visionary language unsupported
by experience. The history of all
ages informs us, that France, where other
weapons have failed, has constantly had recourse
to the less alarming weapons of intrigue
and corruption. And how effectual
these have sometimes been, we have a recent
and tragical example in the total enslaving of
Corsica.</p>

<p>I have been thus particular in enumerating
the evils that may result from the refusal of
Lord Halifax, not from a desire of aggravating
that nobleman’s offence, but merely to
evince the necessity of a speedy enquiry, while
there is yet a chance of its not being wholly
fruitless. Though the course of my narrative
has unavoidably led me to accuse his
Lordship, accusation is not my object, but
enquiry, which cannot be disagreeable to any
but those to whom truth itself is disagreeable.
In pursuing this point, I have hitherto been
frustrated from the very circumstance which
ought to have insured my success, the immense
importance of the question. It has
been apprehended, how justly I know not,
that any magistrate, who should commence
an enquiry, or any gentleman who should
openly move for it, would be deemed responsible
for the truth of the charge, and subjected
to severe penalties, if he could not
make it good. This imagination, however,
did not deter me, though single and unprotected,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
from carrying my papers to the Speaker,
to be laid before the late House of Commons.
The Speaker was pleased to justify my conduct,
by allowing, that the affair ought to
be enquired into, but refused at the same
time to be instrumental in promoting the enquiry
himself. What then remained to be
done? What, but to wait, though with reluctance
and impatience, till a proper opportunity
should offer for appealing to the public
at large, that is, till the accumulated errors
of government should awaken a spirit of enquiry
too powerful to be resisted or eluded?
That this spirit is now reviving, we have a
sufficient earnest in the unanimous zeal you
have shewn for the appointment of a county
meeting. In such a conjuncture, to withold
from you so important a truth, would no
longer be prudence, it would be to disgrace
my former conduct, it would shew that I had
been actuated by some temporary motives,
and not by a steady and uniform regard to national
good. Indeed, the declared purpose of
your meeting is in itself a call upon every
freeholder to disclose whatever you are concerned
to know. I obey this call without
hesitation, submitting the prosecution of the
affair to your judgment, in full confidence
that the result of your deliberations will do
honour at the same time to your prudence,
candour, and patriotism.</p>

<p>Vous pretendez que “dans l’ete de 1764,

<p>Je vous declare en consequence ici Monsieur,
que je n’ai jamais ni fait faire aucune ouverture
pareille, ni dans l’hiver, ni dans l’ete
de 1764, ni dans aucun tems. Je suis d’une
part trop fidele au ministere que j’ai rempli,
et de l’autre trop zelateur de la verite.</p>

<p>J’avoue que vous ne dites pas que ce soit
moi qui aie fait ces propositions: Mais seulement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
qu’elles ont ete fait en mon nom,

me feroit detester.</p>

<p>Je vous interpelle donc, M. le Docteur, de
declarer au public le nom du temeraire qui
s’est servi du mien pour faire ces ouvertures
odieuses. Ces Messieurs que vous avez denonce
comme vos temoins, ne peuvent vous
refuser de venger leur veracite &amp; la votre.</p>

<p>Quoique je ne puisse m’empecher de louer
votre droiture qui cite ses auteurs, cependant
il me paroit de la derniere imprudence, dans
une affaire d’une pareille gravite, de vous
fonder sur un raport pour nommer publiquement
un homme de mon caractere, sans l’avoir
auparavant consulte. Si vous vous etiez souvenu
du dementi que j’ai donne dans le S.
James’s Chronicle du 25 Octobre 1766, No.
881, a un avertissement du meme papier, No.
875, qui portoit en substance ce que vous
alleguez dans votre derniere lettre, vous
m’auriez epargne la peine de vous repondre
aujourdhui. Qu’en va-t-il arriver? Le public
aura lu avidement votre lettre, aura ajoute
foi a son contenu parceque vous en appellez a
mon evidence: Mais qu’en pensera t-il maintenant?
quand votre interet, mon honneur
&amp; la verite m’obligent a nier ce que vous y
avancez a mon sujet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>Il en est de meme de ce que vous pretendez
que “vers le 17 Mai 1765, M. Fitzherbert
vous auroit dit savoir qu’on m’avoit fait des
propositions de vendre pour une somme
d’argent les papiers qui etoient entre mes
mains.”</p>

<p>Je me suis toujours flatte de l’estime &amp; de
l’amitie des Anglois avec lesquels j’ai vecu.
Qui d’eux dans ces sentimens auroit ose me
temoigner assez de mepris pour me faire une
pareille proposition? L’injure m’en auroit ete
d’autant plus sensible que le caractere de la
personne auroit ete plus respectable.</p>

<p>Je ne vous suivrai, Monsieur, ni dans les
demarches que vous avez cru devoir faire, ni
dans les raisonnemens dont vous vous servez
pour les appuier: Ceux-ci montrent l’orateur
&amp; celles-la, si elles sont fondees, preuvent le

je ne puis vous etre d’aucune utilite, que je
ne suis jamais entre en marche pour la vente
de mes papiers, &amp; que je n’ai jamais, ni par

Jugez maintenant, Monsieur, avec quelle solidite
vous pouvois vous fonder sur moi pour
rendre votre accusation evidente!</p>

<p>Je suis trop connu en Angleterre pour avoir
eu besoin de cette reponse, si la franchise de

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Translation of the Chevalier <span class="antiqua">D’Eon</span>’s Answer<br>
to Dr. <span class="antiqua">Musgrave’s</span> Address.</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="gesperrt">SIR</span>,</p>

<p class="dropcap">You will permit me to believe that
you never knew any more of me, than
I have the honour of knowing of you: and if
in your letter of the 12th of August you had
not made a wrong use of my name, I should
not now find myself obliged to enter into a
correspondence with you.</p>

<p>You pretend that “in the summer of the
year 1764, overtures were made in my
name to several members of parliament,
importing that I was ready to impeach
three persons, two of whom were peers
and members of the privy council, of
having sold the peace to the French:” and
you seem to found thereupon the evidence of
a charge, which you say you carried yourself
to Lord Halifax.</p>

<p>I declare, therefore, here, Sir, that I never
made, nor caused to be made any such overture,
either in the winter or summer of the
year 1764, nor at any other time: I am,
on one side, too faithful to the office I
filled, and on the other too zealous a friend
to truth.</p>

<p>I confess you do not say it was I that made
these overtures; but only that they were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
made in my name, particularly to Sir George
Yonge and Mr. Fitzherbert.</p>

<p>I assure you I do not know either of these
gentlemen, and never authorised any person
whatever to make in my name such overtures,
which the abhorrence alone I have
for calumny, would make me detest.</p>

<p>I call upon you, therefore, Sir, to lay before
the public the name of the audacious
person who has made use of mine to cover
his own odious offers. The gentlemen whom
you have given as your witnesses, cannot deny
you this justification of their own veracity
and your’s.</p>

<p>Though I cannot but commend your integrity
in citing your authors, yet it appears
to me an act of the last imprudence, in an
affair of so much weight, to build upon report,
for naming publickly a person of my
character, without having previously consulted
him. If you had recollected the contradiction
I gave in the St. James’s Chronicle
of Oct. 25, 1766, No. 881, to an advertisement
in the same paper, No. 875, importing
in substance what you alledge in your last
letter, you had saved me the trouble of replying
to you at this time. What must be
the result? The public will have read greedily
your letter; will have believed it’s contents,
because you appeal therein to my
testimony: but what will they think now
when your own interest, my honour and
truth oblige me to deny all that you have
advanced thereon with respect to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>It is the same with your pretence that
“about the 17th of May, 1765, Mr. Fitzherbert
told you, he knew that overtures
had been made to me to sell for a sum
of money the papers that were in my
hands.”</p>

<p>I have always flattered myself with being
possessed of the esteem and friendship of the
English with whom I have lived. Who of
them then in these sentiments would have
presumed to have shewn sufficient contempt
for me to have made me such an overture?
The injury would have been the more sensibly
felt by me, as the character of the person
was more respectable.</p>

<p>I shall not follow you, Sir, either in all the
steps you have thought it your duty to take,
or in the arguments you made use of to support
them: these shew the orator, and those,
if they be well founded, prove the patriot.</p>

<p>But I here certify to you, on my word of
honour, and in the face of the public, that I
cannot be of any sort of use to you; that
I never entered into any treaty for the sale of
my papers, and never either by myself or any
agent authorised on my part, offered to make
appear, that the peace had been sold to
France.</p>

<p>If Lord Halifax, or the Speaker, to whom
you say you addressed yourself in order to
call upon me as evidence, with respect to the
validity of your charge, had caused me to be
cited, he might have known by my answers
what my thoughts were, that England rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
gave money to France than France to England,
to conclude the last peace; and that the
happiness I had in concurring to the great
work of peace has inspired me with sentiments
of the justest veneration for the English
commissioners who had been employed
in it, and with the most lively esteem and sincerest
admiration for the late Count de Viry,
who in his attachment to the welfare of the
two nations then at war, and thanks to his
indefatigable zeal! had the glory of bringing
that peace to a happy conclusion.</p>

<p>Judge now, Sir, with what solidity you can
depend upon me to make your charge clear.</p>

<p>I am too well known in England to have
been under any necessity of this reply, if the
frankness of your letter had not appeared to
me to merit my preventing you from taking
any further steps, which could not but turn
to your prejudice, in as much as they would
be founded solely on false reports of <i>my</i> proceedings.</p>

<p>In order to enable you to be as prudent as
patriotic, I sign this letter, and therein give
you my address, that for the maintenance of
your own veracity you may furnish me with
the means of convicting publickly those slanderers
who have dared to make use of my
name, in a manner still more repugnant to real
facts, than the dignity with which I have ever
supported my character.</p>

<p>I have the honour of being your most humble
servant,</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="gesperrt">LETTER </span>I.</h2>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="gesperrt">SIR</span>,</p>

<p class="dropcap">I have read with particular attention
your letter to Dr. Musgrave, and can no
longer be in doubt what your business at present
is in a country where you are an <i>outlaw</i>.</p>

<p>You exhibit to us a character most singularly
profligate. You alone in this age have had
it in your power to be equally false and treacherous
to two such great nations as England
and France. While you were only secretary
to the Duke of Nivernois, you abused the
privileges of your character, and engaged in
the dirty business of <i>debauching our manufacturers</i>.
You so entirely forgot the dignity of
your rank afterwards, when Minister Plenipotentiary,
that you continued the same practice,
although it is contrary to the law of nations.
You do not even blush to charge
this article of expence in the state of your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
disbursements to the Comte de Guerchy.
“Avance aux ouvriers Anglois de la manufacture
de toiles peintes, tant hommes que
femmes, debauche par le Sieur <i>L’Escalier</i>
a Londres et des environs pour les faire
passer ailleurs 195l.” Lettres, Memoires,
&amp;c. p. 172. The meanness and rascality
of such an employment in you and Monsieur
<i>L’Escalier</i> can only be equalled by the tameness
and ignominy of the administration at
that time in suffering <i>L’Escalier</i>, a notorious
pimp and an <i>outlaw</i> here, to be after this in
the public character of <i>Secretary</i> of the Comte
de Guerchy. The attestations of <i>L’Escalier’s
outlawry</i> were printed here, witnessed by Solomon
Schomberg, a Notary Public, and by
the Lord Mayor. They were dispersed at
the Hague, to serve the purpose of shewing at
a certain juncture that England was bullied by
France. You afterwards quarrelled with all
your best friends, as well as with the ministers
of your fortune, and your own Court, which
had raised you so rapidly from nothing, from
being a writer to the police at Paris on the pension
of 600 livres, or 25 guineas a year, to the
dignity of Minister Plenipotentiary at the
most important Court in Europe. Modern
times scarcely produce an instance of political
treachery equal to your’s in printing the secrets
of the Court by whom you were employed,
and the private letters of your benefactor
the Duke of Nivernois, of Monsieur
Sainte-Foy, Monsieur Moreau, &amp;c. Your
particular quarrel with Guerchy had nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
to do with the sentiments of the Duke of
Nivernois, of Mess. Sainte-Foy, Moreau, and
other gentlemen, on the conduct of the
French parliament, the administration of
their finances, &amp;c. which were intrusted to
you, as their private friend, under the seal of
secrecy. You betrayed their confidence without
the least provocation on their part, or a
pretence of justification of your own conduct
from any one circumstance in those letters.
After quarrelling with almost all your
own countrymen, you published in the same
volume a gross abuse of this nation, and called
the English a parcel of fools and madmen,
at the very time that this country afforded
you an honourable protection, and
an hospitality you have abused. “Apres
deux secousses de tremblement de terre, qui
arriverent ici en 1750, <i>un soldat enthousiaste</i>
s’avisa d’en predire un troisieme, qui devoit
renverser Londres. Il se dit inspire,
&amp; d’un ton enthousiaste en fixa le jour,
l’heure, &amp; la minute. Londres consterne
au souvenir des deux secousses qui s’etoient
suivies dans l’intervalle d’un mois, &amp; plus
effraie encore a l’approache d’un troisieme
&amp; plus terrible tremblement que ce soldat
enthousiaste avoit annonce pour le 5 d’Avril,
la ville s’est montree susceptible de toutes
sortes d’impressions. Plus de 50 mille habitans,
sur la foi de cet oracle, avoient ce
jour-la pris la fuite: la plupart de ceux
que les raisonnemens ou les raillerie de
leurs amis avoient retenue, attendoient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
en tremblant l’instant critique, &amp; n’ont
montre de courage qu’apres qu’il a ete
passe. Le jour arrive, la prophetie, semblable
a la plupart des predictions, ne fut
point accomplie; le faux Samuel fut mis
un peu tard aux petites maisons &amp; <i>la tete
de ces fiers insulaires si senses &amp; si philosophes ne
fut pas a l’epreuve de la prophetie d’un fou</i>.”
P. 14. I believe there is not to be found so
gross and silly an abuse of a whole nation
for the weakness of a few hysteric women,
and superannuated men, nor so false a representation
of any fact. Were your other dispatches
to your court, Sir, composed of such
wretched stuff as this? I hope the <i>bottle-conjurer</i>
finds his place in the second part of
your <i>memoires</i>. That innocent joke of the
late Duke of Montague, your countrymen
generally talk and write of as a serious proof
of the folly and credulity of this nation.
The English laughed at your weak attack on
them as a nation, and superior to such abuse,
desired that you might continue to enjoy
the protection of their noble system of
laws, and the privileges of their country.
They considered their own glory, not the
worthlessness of the individual. They would
have parted with so insignificant a wretch
as you without the least regret; but they
would not suffer you to be forced away,
nor kidnapped, merely because it would
have been an outrage to their laws, and
the honour of their nation. They too,
as politicians, thought you might be induced
to make some discoveries, and were ready<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
to profit by your treason to your own
country in the secrets you might reveal for
the benefit of their’s, but at the same time
they would have abhorred the traitor. When
I mention the English nation as anxious for
your safety, I mean the body of the people.
The administration <i>at that time</i> wished that
you might be carried off to France. Mansfield
and Norton saw Guerchy often on the
occasion, and Sandwich signed more than
one warrant to apprehend you. The French
ministry, and the people here in power at
that time, planned your destruction; but
the generosity of two or three individuals
saved you, and preserved a viper in the bosom
of their country. Now is just the season
for such noxious reptiles to come forth.
They always meet the approaching storm.
Leagued with the enemies of our country,
whether French or English, your slender abilities
are still employed against a nation
you hate, but in your heart honour and revere.
After having for some years talked
very openly of the wonderful discoveries you
could make, and the impeachment you
could support, after frequently declaring,
that <i>you had two heads in your pocket</i>, when a
worthy gentleman steps forth and states the
charge, you at once recoil, and declare that
you do not even believe a word of it, but
think that <i>l’Angleterre a plutot donne de l’argent
a la France, que la France de l’or a l’Angleterre
pour conclure la derniere paix</i>. So absurd an
idea I shall not undertake to refute, because
I believe you are the only man <i>at large</i>, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
entertains it; but I shall in this first address
to you, desire you to state <i>two</i> facts to the
public, relative to the subject of your letter
to Dr. Musgrave. The <i>first</i> is, What was the
negociation relative to the island of <i>Porto-Rico</i>?
The Duke of Bedford set out for Paris,
Sept. 5, 1762. Every thing of importance
was soon entirely settled between the
two courts. The most material arrangements
had been made here in private with
Lord Bute before his Grace’s departure. The
news of the taking the Havannah was afterwards
first received in England, while the
Duke was in Paris, on Sept. 29. Now I
ask what alteration in the terms of the treaty
did such important intelligence produce?
What was to be given England, additional
to the former stipulations, in consequence
of the surrender of the Havannah, when that
likewise was to be given up? You are called
upon to state that transaction; what you
know of the ten days cession of Porto Rico
to us by the negociation at Paris, and the
subsequent surrender of that island on the receipt
of <i>two</i> letters from hence, one of which
the Duke of Bedford ought to produce for
his justification in <i>that part</i> of the business;
the other is too sacred to appear. The <i>second</i>
question I shall now ask is, <i>whether you have
not declared that you were offered 7000 louis for
your papers?</i> Your letter to Dr. Musgrave is
extremely evasive on this head. You say,
“Je me suis toujours flatte de l’estime &amp; de
l’amitie <i>des Anglois</i> avec lesquels j’ai vecu.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
<i>Qui d’eux</i> dans ces sentimens auroit ose me
temoigner assez de mepris pour me faire
une pareille proposition?” No, Sir, <i>no Englishman</i>
was employed in so dirty a business;
but one of your own country was found to
make the proposition, to which you objected.
You said the sum was too trifling for papers
of such importance. My other letters shall
give the world more truths; for I will drag
you forth to the public view, not merely as
a trifling Frenchman, trifling in every thing
serious, and serious only in trifles, but as
the enemy of England, as a pensioned tool
of a wicked ministry, who hope by your
means to trifle or perplex an enquiry, which
may not stop at your patron, the detested
<i>Thane</i>, to whom, although a Frenchman,
you have sacrificed the great <i>Sully</i> in the most
fulsome and lying of all dedications, prefixed
to your pirated <i>Considerations Historiques &amp; Politiques
sur les Impos</i>.</p>

<p>Your connections, Sir, are at length discovered,
and the plan of your operations, so
secretly concerted by Bute’s three deputies,
Jenkinson, Dyson, and <i>Target</i> Martin, at a
house in Pall Mall, which governs this kingdom,
shall be given to the public. You will
experience, that although English generosity
makes us always ready to give refuge and
protection to a distressed foreigner, even from
the country of our inveterate enemies, we
will not suffer among us a French traitor
and a spy, in the pay of an administration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
odious to this whole nation. I shall only at
present add, that one of your friends will
soon prove to you that your own poet <i>Corneille</i>
says very truly,</p>

<p><i>Et meme avec justice on peut trahir un traitre.</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="gesperrt">LETTER </span>II.<br>
<span class="smaller"><i>To the Chevalier <span class="antiqua">D’Eon</span>.</i></span></h2>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="gesperrt">SIR</span>,</p>

<p class="dropcap">The warm applause you give to the
peace of Paris, and the negociators of
it, both English and French, did not in the
least surprise me. You were well paid for it
at the time, and the private advantages derived
to you from it did not cease with its
<i>ratification</i>. The peace itself was in its own
nature so infamous, and so peculiarly <i>felonious</i>
to this country, which it robbed of almost
all its noble conquests, that no Englishman
was judged proper to be sent with the authentic
ratification of such a French bargain.
It was given to you <i>contre toute regle &amp; contre
toute usage</i>, as the Duke de Praslin says in your
<i>Memoires</i>; and the Duke of Nivernois observes
in a letter to the Duke of Bedford,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
that it was <i>une galanterie de votre ministere, &amp;
une bonte du Roi votre maitre, qui se sert avec
plaisir <span class="smcap">d’un Francois</span> pour cette tournure</i>.
Besides, at the very time of the negociation
you held the Ambassador’s pen; and altho’
you were never entrusted with the most important
secrets between the two courts, you
were employed in the revisal of that fatal instrument
which tore from our bleeding warriors
the fruits of all their victories, the greatest
acquisitions your rival nation had ever made.
You are allowed to have much chicanery;
and the tricking article about the Canada Bills
was the effect of your duping the Duke of
Bedford, and the good-humoured Mr. Neville.
You may therefore with reason speak of the
peace of Paris in terms of rapture, as a
Frenchman, and as the Duke of Nivernois’s
secretary. I will ever mention it with indignation;
for I am an Englishman, and have
not that load of guilt to expiate to my
country, the advising, making, or <i>approving</i>
so ruinous a measure. You are, however,
Sir, by no means singular in your opinion of
the late <i>peace</i> even in this nation. We too
have many traitors among us. A set of gentlemen
at Westminster gave an <i>entire approbation</i>
of the <i>preliminary articles</i>, even with the
very extraordinary original clause about the
East-India Company among them. Their
bankers best know how that <i>approbation</i> was
obtained; but their successors, altho’ careless
about the national debt, have had the
prudence as well as foresight for themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
to pay off all debts contracted on that account.</p>

<p>You speak with some degree of modesty
concerning yourself when you mention the
peace of Paris, as if conscious that you had
only been employed to toll the bell for the
funeral of England’s departed glory and
fame. When you mention Count <i>Viry</i>,
you are quite lavish in his praises, knowing
how much he had been a principal in that
accursed treaty. I respect the dead; but
only the departed virtuous and good. I distinguish
characters, notwithstanding the
trite maxim of <i>de mortuis nil nisi bonum</i>. I
will never confound a Cato and a Cataline,
but will give to each their due. I execrate
the memory of Count Viry, as the enemy of
my country, as having been a principal in
robbing England of the <i>Havannah</i>, <span class="smcap">Porto
Rico</span>, <i>Martinique</i>, <i>Guadelupe</i>, <i>Desiderade</i>, <i>Mariegalante</i>,
<i>St. Peter</i>, <i>Miquelon</i>, <i>Goree</i>, <i>Belleisle</i>,
<i>St. Lucia</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> and negociating a treaty
which has proved the salvation of France. I
believe you have, besides the general cause of
the peace, which saved France, two particular
reasons for the regard you testify to the
memory of Count Viry. The first is the
very dexterous management he used to get
the claim of a sugar island from France
waved, in which you knew she was ready to
have acquiesced. The other is, the protest
he signed in favour of the House of Savoy,
which he procured to be legally attested and
given in at the time of the last coronation, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
the name of his master, the present King of
Sardinia. He too in your time had printed
the <i>Genealogie de la Famille Royale d’Angleterre</i>,
by which he hoped at a future day that the
ridiculous claims of his master’s family, as
being, although Papists, immediately descended
from Henrietta Maria, the daughter
of Charles I. would have prevailed over
those of the House of Brunswick, who are
descended from Elizabeth, Electress Palatine,
one degree more remote from the
Crown, as being the daughter of James I.
You both expected at least a general confusion
speedily among us; but neither you, nor he,
born under arbitrary governments, could
have any idea of the only lawful right to the
crown of these realms, a parliamentary right.
The contrary doctrine was in Queen Anne’s
time expresly declared to be <i>high treason</i>,
by a particular statute, the “Act for the
better securing her Majesty’s person and
government, and the succession to the
crown of England in the protestant line;”
<i>That if any person or persons, from and after the
25th day of March 1706, shall maliciously, advisedly
and directly, by writing or printing, declare,
maintain, or affirm that the Kings or Queens
of England, with and by the authority of the parliament
of England, are not able to make laws and
statutes of sufficient force and validity to limit and
bind the crown of this realm, and the <span class="smcap">descent,
limitation, inheritance</span>, and government
thereof, every such person or persons shall be
guilty of High Treason, and being thereof convicted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
and attainted, &amp;c. &amp;c.</i> Count Viri acted
by the express orders of his Court, in conjunction
with your’s. In the same manner
the two Courts acted in concert at the beginning
of this century, in the last year of
our glorious Deliverer, King William III.
Count Maffei, the Ambassador from Savoy,
delivered in the first famous protestation, in
the name of the Duchess of Savoy, against
the Hanover succession, at the time the Duke
himself commanded the French army in
Italy, with Marshal Catinat and the Prince
of Vaudemont under him, and every action
of his life was dictated by France. I believe
you therefore <i>unusually</i> sincere, when you
express, “la plus vive estime &amp; la plus sincere
admiration pour feu Monsieur le
Comte de Viry, qui par son attachement
pour le bien des deux nations belligerantes
&amp; graces a son zele infatiguable, eut la
gloire d’amener cette paix necessaire aux
deux nations a une heureuse conclusion.”
What this <i>happy conclusion</i> for England was,
we have already seen. From that fatal moment
France, like a tall bully, began again
to lift the head, and insult all its neighbours.</p>

<p>You tell Dr. Musgrave, “le public aura
lu avidement votre lettre, aura adjute
foi a son contenu parceque vous en appellez
a mon evidence.” You are mistaken.
Your evidence of itself will have little weight
with any one, but you may have papers of
importance, which the public expected from
<i>your own absolute promise</i>. The last page of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
your tiresome quarto promised a second volume
on the first of June 1764, and a third
the first of September. You ought to have
given them at the stipulated time, and to
have made them as valuable as you could
from the materials of others, were it only to
indemnify us for having waded through the
family dullness and impertinence of the letters
to your mother, nurse, &amp;c. &amp;c. What
did the Scot give you for the suppression?
Was it as much as you had for the dedication,
in which you tell him that you find
“dans les portraits du Duc de Sully &amp; de
Milord Bute une ressemblance assez parfaite,
de grandes vertus, l’amour de la
patrie (<i>Scotland I suppose</i>) de la philosophie;
la profondeur d’un politique, l’eloquence
d’un homme d’etat, cette activite d’esprit
qui donne les succes &amp; les revers, ce coup
d’œil qui demele les objets meme au milieu
du trouble, qui fait le grand negociateur,
&amp;c. &amp;c.” Upon my word you merited the
whole sum he gave you, let it have been
ever so considerable. But did you believe
one single feature of <i>Bute</i> was like <i>Sully</i>? I
am satisfied no more than your master the
Duke of Nivernois, Ambassador and Academician,
one of your <i>quarante immortels</i>, believed
that the Kings of England and France
were <i>faits pour s’aimer, formed to love each
other</i>, although he declared so at St. James’s
with the utmost gravity, and afterwards
printed it, like a compliment of the French
Academy, only in both French and English<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
for the amusement of the two nations. The
flattery of the French ambassador and secretary
succeeded. The English monarch and his
Scottish minister were equally captivated; and
the most gallant army in Europe were left to
regret that they had not once the honour even
of a visit from our sovereign during the
whole war, or before they were disbanded.
The early and dangerous intrigues, the specious
flattery of a home favourite, and an insinuating
foreign minister, but above all the
holding out in such terms, <i>le charactere distinctif
d’une bonne foi non equivoque</i>, at which
the King of Prussia has so much laughed,
lulled asleep all heroism, suspicion, and even
curiosity.</p>

<p>You are very just, Sir, in the observation,
that the public read with great eagerness Dr.
Musgrave’s letter. The reason is plain. The
fact, that French gold made the last peace,
was long ago believed; but the public rejoiced
when a man of Dr. Musgrave’s unblemished
reputation stated the presumptive
evidence in general terms to his countrymen
of Devonshire, because then it seemed impossible
any longer to stifle the enquiry. You
say, “Je vous interpelle donc, M. le Docteur,
de declarer au public le nom du temeraire
qui s’est servi du mien pour faire
ces ouvertures odieuses.” The Doctor
does not say that he ever heard the name of
the person, who, <i>in your name</i>, applied to Sir
George Yonge, Mr. Fitzherbert, and several
other members of parliament. He only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
declares that Sir George Yonge and Mr. Fitzherbert
informed him <i>at different times</i> that
<i>an overture had been made <span class="smcap">in the name</span> of
the Chevalier d’Eon, importing that he, the
Chevalier, was ready to impeach three persons,
two of whom are peers and members of the
privy council, of selling the peace to the French</i>.
Why do you not make your appeal to these
two gentlemen? If neither of the placemen
should chuse to answer, if they are either
fearful or false, if the <i>boards of admiralty and
trade</i> have exacted at least a promise of secrecy,
I will name a third person to you, a
character unexceptionable, of a candour, probity,
and honour equal to Dr. Musgrave’s,
superior I believe never existed. I mean
Thomas Cholmondeley, Esq; the late member
for Cheshire, a relation of Lord Chatham.
My reason for naming this gentleman
you will see in the following passage. “It
is true (<i>Pitt</i>) assisted in the first debate
upon General Warrants in 1764; but finding
that some of the party were in earnest
in their designs of going farther, and had
prepared a motion against the seizure of
papers, which was, in fact, the great
grievance; and also finding that the <i>favourite</i>
dreaded the minority gaining a
victory, lest the party should be afterwards
turned against him; and that the <i>favourite</i>
had therefore supported the administration
with all his might upon this occasion,
the great patriot scandalously withdrew
from the cause and the party; thereby<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
<i>preventing</i> any point being then gained
towards that security of public liberty,
which the whole kingdom so ardently
wished for and expected. A short time
afterwards, when an <span class="smcap">impeachment
of the favourite</span> was privately rumoured
among a few only; and it was
said, that there was strong evidence ready
to be given, <i>particularly with regard to the
peace</i>; when a certain baronet, and others,
who took some pains in order to come at
this evidence, and the conditions upon
which it might have been obtained were
trifling, not pecuniary (<i>the pardon of the
Chevalier D’Eon is here meant</i>) and who
thought it necessary that the great Commoner
should be consulted upon a subject
of such importance, especially too as he
was looked upon to be the fittest person to
lead, or principally support such a procedure;
and when, in consequence of that
idea, he was applied to by one of his own
friends, and, in some measure, a distant
relation, he checked the whole in the bud,
by declaring vehemently against it.” <i>An
enquiry into the conduct of the late Right Honourable
Commoner</i>, page 26, <i>&amp;c.</i> published
in 1766. The strange phrase <i>Pitt</i> used was,
<i>that he would set his foot on the head of the
man who first moved the enquiry, and crush him
to atoms</i>. I am very glad to hear that the
<i>three brothers</i> are at last united, and that
there is now not only a family, but a political
union among them. I venture however<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
to prophesy, that two of the three will never
promote an enquiry into the transactions of
the last <i>peace</i>, or the conduct of the <i>favourite</i>,
and I therefore hope all the friends of the
public will be on their guard against them
both. They cannot safely be trusted with
the conduct of this important business. The
<i>apostate</i> had in 1764 his peerage and place of
Privy Seal in view, for which he then sold
his friends and his country. He now looks
forwards to a more lucrative office, a larger
pension to recruit his shattered finances, and
perhaps to a higher title, which he may probably
get, if he can keep the favourite’s head
on his shoulders. I wish however the <i>triumvirate</i>
of brothers success, because I think a
<i>triumvirate</i>, which should be only insolent
and overbearing, is infinitely to be preferred
to a sole minister who is cruel; and <i>delights
in blood</i>.</p>

<p>I should before this, Monsieur le Chevalier,
have apologized to you for the frankness
of my proceeding with respect to you,
and the plain language of my heart, but
really my nature is open and undisguised. I
detest flattery and foolish compliments. I
call things generally by their names, <i>j’appelle
un chat un chat, et rolet un fripon</i>. Besides
your example ought to weigh in an address to
you. The embassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary
of your court, a Cordon Bleu,
who represented the person of the Most Christian
King, you repeatedly in the grossest manner
call <i>ane extraordinaire</i>, and you add, <i>la<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
truye n’ennoblit pas le cochon</i>. Monsieur Bussy,
the late French minister here, is with you a
<i>bourreau</i>. Your language even to your own
mother is particularly rude. You advise a
tender affectionate parent, in tears for the
misconduct of a son she loved, to <i>wipe her
eyes, plant her cabbages, weed her garden, eat her
greens, and drink the milk of her cows and the
wine of her vineyard</i>, without giving herself
any trouble about you. The letter to your
nurse, Madame Benoit a Tonnerre, is rather
more obliging. You talk of all her <i>soins et
peines passees</i>, and then very elegantly add,
that <i>you are well at present, but should be better if
you could see her soon</i>. To her you act the <i>signor
magnifico</i>; you actually send her one hundred
livres, or near four pounds and eight
shillings sterling. How interesting is all
this to the public? how glorious to you?
But to return to your poor mother, whom I
heartily pity. You tell her in return for her
concern, that you have read <i>toutes les lettres lamentables
et pitoyables que vous avez pris la peine
de m’ecrire: pourquoi pleurez vous, femme de peu
de foi?</i> You make use here, Sir, of our Blessed
Saviour’s words in a very strange and indecent
manner. You speak of him in your last
publication, <i>in a most daring and really impudent
stile</i>. In the <i>Pieces Authentiques</i>, page 13,
your words are, <i>on n’accusa point Jesus Christ
au Banc d’Herode d’avoir debite des libelles; cependant

Jesus Christ was not accused at Herod’s Bench of
having published libels; although what our Saviour
advanced was never so well proved as what
the Chevalier D’Eon has demonstrated in his
<span class="smcap">Letters and Memoirs</span>.</i> After all these
instances I shall conclude without the least

<p class="dropcap">Lord B. and his toad eater the D.
of G. both knew the contents of
Dr. Musgrave’s letter many weeks before
it made its appearance. They had concerted
many schemes to suppress its publication;
but all these schemes, however artfully
managed, proved abortive. Lord B.
who came fresh from the school of politics
at Rome, embraced still the same propensity
for absolute monarchy as he did before he
departed from England. He is grown, indeed,
more cautious, more masked, but not
a jot less enterprising. Foiled in his well-concealed
attempts to prevent the publication
of Dr. Musgrave’s letter, his next attempt
was to render the publication of it inoperative
and ineffectual. The difficulty lay in
compassing this desirable end. He knew
very well that one ******** had married a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
cast-off, who formerly held no mean rank in
his toad eater’s seraglio: this same ********,
his Lordship knew had been confidently
intrusted at different times, with the most
important secrets of Mr. Wilkes, the Chevalier
D’Eon, and Lord Temple, and therefore
the only fit person to be confidentially
entrusted, as far as his Lordship might deem
necessary, with the opening a negociation
for a treaty of union between the Earls of
B—e, T——e, E———t, C———m, Lord
H———d, and the petulant Duke of B———.
Such a coalition, with his toad eater at the
head, he rightly conceived, would be able to
stem any torrent of opposition, were it to roll
mountains high. But his Lordship, it will
be seen, counted without his host. His first
intention was to dispatch ******** to Stow.
This measure could not be carried into execution
but by another mode of application.
******** had already forfeited Lord T——e’s
confidence, but he did not care to acquaint
either G. or B. with this secret, which
could not but be fatal to his own views; he
therefore artfully declined going to Stow
himself, adding, that the embassy would have
greater weight, and probably better success,
was the D. of G. to wait in person on Lord
T———. ******** pretended to know the
very bait that would tempt his Lordship; it
was nothing less than a Dukedom, and if
he ********, was to make the offer, Lord
T———e, he said, might doubt the performance.
By this device and advice of ********,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
B. and his toad eater were easily betrayed
into a fond belief of gaining over Lord T.
to their faction. Accordingly, the D. of
G. was posted down to Stow, and this truly
courtly visit was immediately announced in
every news-paper throughout the kingdom.
The success of this visit is no longer a mystery.
The wild, incoherent, crude plan of
operations, were conveyed, without loss of
time, to Fonthill, and from Fonthill it soon
arrived at Plymouth. Dr. Musgrave finding
this once formidable and blood-thirsty faction
tottering, and failing of support from
Lord T. thought it a glorious opportunity
to crush the whole junto, by hanging them
out to public view and public odium. With
this view, and to do justice to a brave, but
greatly injured people, the Doctor, with a
courage not to be daunted, published that
well-timed letter, which has already unfilm’d
the eyes of every subject in the kingdom, and
which, in a few days, will receive a further
elucidation from</p>

<p class="dropcap">In my former letter I furnished your readers
with an anecdote relative to Mr.
********. This man, who is connected with
his Grace the D. of G. by the apron-string<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
tenure; the present modish, and by much
the strongest of all holds, has been constantly
and most secretly employed for these
last six weeks, as a go-between to the D. of
G. and the Soi-disant l’Homme de Charactere,
M. D’Eon.</p>

<p>To throw a veil over this mysterious negociation,
and in order to blind the eyes of
the prying public, the pretty Frenchman
who lives in Petty France, has for this fortnight
past been roaring out in every coffee-house
he frequents, that Mr. ********, the go-between
above-mentioned, has betrayed his
most sacred secrets to the D. of G. and the
whole B———d junto. This flimsy, gausy
device, was no sooner made public, but it
was seen through by every tyro in politics.
And the Frenchman was compelled by his
new employers to lay aside the mask. He
was ordered by this new sett of masters, who
will always tyrannize over him in proportion
to the pension they give him: he was ordered
I say flatly to deny every circumstance in Dr.
Musgrave’s patriotic letter, and boldly to assert,
“that he never entered into any treaty
for the sale of his papers.” Nothing is
so easy to a Frenchman, especially if they
have been once initiated into the diplomatic
corps, as to assert one thing for another,
where they know they cannot for the present
moment be detected. But what will the good
people of England think of the veracity of
this same Frenchman, when I call upon him
in this public manner to declare for what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
reason, at whose instigation, and for what
valuable consideration in money, he suppressed
the publication of <i>those three letters</i> relative
to the late peace-makers?</p>

<p>I know, Mr. Printer, I speak ænigmatically
to the generality of your readers, when I talk
of three letters. But the D. of B———d understands
me; Lord B—— understands me;
and D’Eon, if he has any regard for truth,
ought to blush at the bare mention of those
three letters. There is but one moral tie can
bind a French gentleman, that is, his word
of honour. Let D’Eon then, if he dare, lay
his hand upon his Croix de St. Louis, and
swear, upon his <i>honour</i>, that he never received
directly or indirectly, without equivocation,
or mental reservation, any money,
pension, emolument, or promise, for suppressing
the publication of the three letters
in question, and he shall either be credited,

<p class="dropcap">Doctor Musgrave’s address to the
freeholders of the county of Devon, and
the Chevalier D’Eon’s answer to it, having
engrossed the public attention, give me leave,
first, to consider the nature and tendency of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
address, and then to make a few remarks on the
Chevalier’s answer.</p>

<p>Mr. Musgrave has told us a series of facts
within his own knowledge, the authenticity
of which are corroborated by the names of
the parties concerned, and the periods in
which they were transacted. He tells us,
that Sir George Yonge, Mr. Fitzherbert, and
other members of parliament, informed him
at different times, that the Chevalier D’Eon
was really to impeach three persons of selling
the peace to the French—that Sir George
Yonge in particular told him, that he understood
the charge could be supported by written
as well as by living evidence. By the direction
of Dr. Blackstone, Mr. Musgrave
went to Lord Halifax <i>on the 10th of May,
1765</i>, and delivered to him an exact narrative
of the intelligence he had received at Paris
concerning the late peace, and at the same
time gave him copies of four letters to and
from Lord Hertford. <i>On the 17th of May,
1765</i>, just seven days after he delivered the
narrative to Lord Halifax, Mr. Fitzherbert
told the Doctor, that overtures were then
making to the Chevalier D’Eon to get his
papers from him for a stipulated sum of money.
Lord Halifax, although repeatedly
pressed by Doctor Musgrave to enquire into
the truth of the charge, first, objected to all
public steps that would lead to the truth, to
avoid giving <i>an alarm</i>; and, at last, absolutely
refused to take any cognizance of it,
either in private or public. Thus frustrated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
in every application to the secretary of state,
the Doctor carried his papers to the Speaker,
who very readily allowed the expediency of
their being laid before the House of Commons,
but at the same time peremptorily refused
to promote the enquiry.</p>

<p>This, Sir, is the substance of Dr. Musgrave’s
address, which carries with it such a
face of authenticity, that nothing but a public
investigation of the facts can exculpate
the parties concerned. As to the tendency of
it, every unprejudiced reader must allow, that
the public good, and not an inclination to aggravate
the guilt of any particular person, was
his object.</p>

<p>If the allegations contained in the address
are not fairly stated—if Doctor Musgrave has
been guilty of injuring private characters,
and of imposing falshoods on the public—why,
in God’s name, is he not contradicted?—Why
do not the accused exculpate themselves?—Why
are not the public undeceived?—Why
should <i>they</i> be silent whose
conduct is principally arraigned, and a vindication,
such as it is, be published by a man,
whose veracity in this respect is by no means
to be relied on? For when his papers were
purchased from him, the condition of the
obligation no doubt was, that their contents
should be buried in oblivion.</p>

<p>When the official conduct of a secretary of
state, or of any other servant of the crown, is
arraigned, the public have an undoubted
right to be satisfied either of their guilt or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
innocence, in order that the law of the land
may in either case take effect. When the
character of an honest man is unjustly and
publicly attacked, he will not postpone the
vindication of his innocence until a legal enquiry
can be set on foot in a court of law;
he ought to exculpate himself through the
same channel he has been accused. Therefore,
until Doctor Blackstone tells us the conversation
that passed between him and Mr.
Musgrave, previous to his waiting on Lord
Halifax—Until Lord Halifax informs us
whether Doctor Musgrave did or did not deliver
to him a narrative of the intelligence he
had received at Paris, concerning the peace
in 1764, and likewise publish the copies of
the four letters to and from Lord Hertford;
which, as they are of a public nature, his
<i>politeness</i> need not stumble at—Until Sir
George Yonge and Mr. Fitzherbert publicly
deny every circumstance relative to their several
conversations with Doctor Musgrave,
especially what passed between Mr. Fitzherbert
and him <i>on the 17th day of May, 1765</i>—And
until the Speaker acquaints us with the
reason why he allowed the expediency of laying
these important papers before the House
of Commons, and at the same time <i>refused to
promote the enquiry</i>—Until all these matters
are promulged and sufficiently authenticated,
the impartial and dispassionate part of mankind
must and will give credit to the facts
contained in the address.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>I come now, Sir, to make a few remarks
on the Chevalier D’Eon’s answer, which I
shall do with the same impartiality I have
considered the address, and leave the public
to draw the line between the honest sincerity
of the Englishman, and the evasive <i>finesse</i> of
the Frenchman.</p>

<p>Monsieur le Chevalier, notwithstanding
his long residence in England, and the esteem
and friendship he is favoured with from <i>some</i>
of the inhabitants (the reason of which he
knows best) still preserves his <i>native</i> insincerity
and politeness. His letter to Dr. Musgrave
is as foreign to the purpose of an answer
to the address, as the conduct of our present
ministry in suffering his master, the Grand
Monarque, to conquer Corsica, was foreign
to the faith of treaty, and repugnant to the
interest of this kingdom—than which no
two positions can be more opposite.</p>

<p>The Chevalier has very <i>politely</i> passed some
French compliments on the doctor’s oratory
and patriotism—has talked a good deal of his
own integrity and zeal for truth—blames
him for naming a person of his <i>vast</i> consequence
in so public a manner, and manfully
denies every circumstance he is publicly
known to have been concerned in at the time
mentioned in the address. But what does all
this amount to with respect to Mr. Musgrave’s
allegations? He, indeed, very justly says, that
the evidence of the Chevalier would have
been decisive at the time he urged Lord Halifax
to send for him to examine him, and to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
peruse his papers which he <i>then</i> had in his
possession; but in his address to the freeholders
of Devon, he neither desires nor expects
any proofs from him <i>now</i>, because he
either knows, or shrewdly suspects, that no
written evidence is now to be found in his
custody.</p>

<p>The Chevalier desires to know the person
or persons in this country, who would have
presumed to make an overture to him for the
sale of his papers—I wish to God I could
tell him!—or rather that I could tell the
public—for the Chevalier himself, I dare
say, wants no information in that affair. It
is much to be wished, however, that Lord
Halifax or the Speaker had examined the
Chevalier, and that it might at least have
been known what sum was paid by England,
and for what consideration it was given to
France, at the conclusion of the last ever memorable
and glorious peace.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="gesperrt">LETTER </span>I.<br>
<span class="smaller">To Dr. MUSGRAVE, of <span class="smcap gesperrt">Plymouth</span>.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="gesperrt">SIR</span>,</p>

<p class="dropcap">The meritorious and intrepid manner
in which you have stepped forth, and
called the public attention to the negociation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
of the last infamous peace, deserves the thanks
and applause of your country. As an individual
of this country, not wholly unacquainted
with some parts of that negociation,
you have my poor thanks: but thanks
alone are not sufficient in such a cause; I
should hold myself the basest of Englishmen,
if I did not contribute my mite towards accomplishing
a full and impartial enquiry
into the manner in which that important
work was conducted. Such parts of the negociation
as have accidentally come to my knowledge,
I shall freely relate. If my account
is true, as I have great reason to believe it is
in general, I hope it will warm some virtuous
man to stand up in his place, and call for the
papers relating to that negociation. In a
pamphlet, intituled, <i>The present State of the
Nation</i>, &amp;c. p. 24, 8vo. edit. published last
winter, there is this extraordinary passage,
evidently alluding to these papers, which
I have often wondered was not taken notice
of; “Whether by the treaty Great
Britain obtained all that she might have
obtained, is a question to which those only
who were acquainted with the secrets of
the French and Spanish cabinets can give
an answer. <i>The correspondence relative to
that negociation has not been laid before the
public</i>; for the last parliament approved of
the peace as it was, without thinking it
necessary to enquire whether better terms
might not have been had.”</p>

<p>The secret of the negociation, or ultimatum,
on the part of England, was neither in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
the D. of B. the B. A. at Paris; nor in the
late Earl of Egremont, the <i>official</i> minister at
home, who was Secretary of State for the
Southern department; but between Lord
Bute and the Sardinian Minister in London,
and the Duc de Choiseul and the Sardinian
Minister at Paris.</p>

<p>The fact, of thus committing the management
of the most important affairs of
Great Britain to the Ministers of a foreign
power, is extraordinary and alarming, and
ought to be considered as highly criminal;
especially when we recollect, that the Sardinian
Minister in London, at the time of his
present Majesty’s coronation, signed a protest
in favour of the House of Savoy, which he
procured to be legally attested and given in,
in the name of the King his master. He
printed, or caused to be printed, ‘the <i>Genealogie
de la Famille Royale d’Angleterre</i>, by
which he hoped, at a future day, that the
ridiculous claims of his master’s family, as
being, although Papists, immediately descended
from Henrietta Maria, the daughter
of Charles I. would have prevailed
over those of the House of Brunswick,
who are descended from Elizabeth, Electress
Palatine, one degree more remote
from the crown, as being the daughter of
James I. He might hope for a general
confusion among us; but being born under
arbitrary government, he could not
have the least idea of the only lawful right
to the crown of these realms, a parliamentary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
right. The contrary doctrine was in
Queen Anne’s time expressly declared to
be <i>high treason</i> by a particular statute, the
“Act for the better securing her Majesty’s
person and government, and of the succession
to the crown of England in the
Protestant line;” ‘<i>That if any person or
persons, from and after the 25th day of March,
1706, shall maliciously, advisedly and directly,
by writing or printing, declare, maintain, or
affirm that the Kings or Queens of England, with
and by the authority of the parliament of England,
are not able to make laws and statutes of
sufficient force and validity to limit and bind the
crown of this realm, and the <span class="smcap">descent, limitation,
inheritance</span>, and government
thereof, every such person or persons shall be
guilty of High Treason, and being thereof convicted
and attainted, &amp;c. &amp;c.</i> Count Viri
acted by the express orders of his Court,
in conjunction with the Court of France.
In the same manner the two Courts acted
in concert at the beginning of this century,
in the last year of our glorious Deliverer,
King William III. Count Maffei, the Ambassador
from Savoy, delivered in the first
famous protestation, in the name of the
Duchess of Savoy, against the Hanover succession,
at the time the Duke himself commanded
the French army in Italy, with
Marshal Catinat and the Prince of Vaudemont
under him, and every action of his
life was dictated by France.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>The present Count V. (who, during his
late father’s life time, was known by the
name of M. De Verois) had a pension
granted him for his services in this negociation
of 1000l. per ann. on the Irish establishment,
though not in his own name.
In the <i>debates relative to the affairs of Ireland,
in the years 1763 and 1764, &amp;c. inscribed by
permission to Lord Chatham</i>, we find this fact
mentioned, Vol. II. page 475, by Mr. Edmund
Sexton Perry, who thus speaks:
“I shall communicate a fact to this House.
There is a pension granted nominally to
one George Charles, but really to Monsieur
De Verois, the Sardinian Minister,
for negociating the peace that has just been
concluded with the Minister of France.
I must confess, Sir, that, in my opinion,
this service deserved no such recompence,
at least on our part. If it is thought a
defensible measure, I should be glad to
know, why it was not avowed; and why,
if it is proper we should pay 1000l. a
year to Mons. De Verois, we should be
made to believe that we pay it to George
Charles.”</p>

<p>Besides the above pension, there was certainly
a remittance from France or Spain, or
both, of a considerable sum of money; but
for whom it was designed is not at present so
certainly known. However, there is no
doubt that Count V. is thoroughly acquainted
with the whole of this transaction:
but now that the affair of the peace begins to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
be enquired into, he is preparing to depart
the kingdom; and has actually sold his pension
upon the Irish Establishment for 16000l.
or thereabouts.</p>

<p>When the D. of B. set out for Paris, which
was on the 5th of September, 1762, he had
<i>full powers</i> to treat with the French ministry
upon the terms of peace. But when he arrived
at Calais, a messenger was dispatched
after him, containing a limitation of those
powers. Upon which, he instantly dispatched
the same messenger back to London,
declaring (by letter) he would proceed no
further, unless his former instructions were
restored. He waited at Calais for the return
of this messenger, who brought a restoration
of his former instructions. However, he submitted,
notwithstanding this affected spirit,
to see the conquests of a glorious war bargained
for and surrendered by the two Sardinian
ministers. In a word, the D. made no
important figure in the negociation, till an
event turned up, which seemed, by the
confusion it occasioned, to be totally unexpected.
This was the capture of the Havannah.</p>

<p>This being only an introductory letter, my
next, I hope, will be more worthy of your
attention; at least, it will contain some important
truths. I am, Sir,</p>

<span class="smaller">To Dr. MUSGRAVE of <span class="smcap gesperrt">Plymouth</span>.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="gesperrt">SIR</span>,</p>

<p class="dropcap">My last letter concluded with the mention
of the conquest of the Havannah.
The news of this important conquest
arrived in England on the 29th of September,
1762, while the treaty of peace was negociating.
Until this period, the D. of
B—— had little or no trouble in the negociation,
for the principle articles or great outlines
of the terms of peace had been previously
settled between Lord Bute and Mons.
De Verois (now Count Viry) in England, and
the Duc de Choiseul and the Sardinian
minister at Paris.</p>

<p>At this time the Right Hon. G—— G——
was Secretary of State for the Northern department,
and by his office (being a commoner)
was to carry the peace through the
House of Commons, when it should be laid
before the House. When the news of the
conquest of the Havannah came, and it was
directly determined by the Favourite to give
up this important island, because it should
not embarrass the negociation, nor impede
the conclusion of the peace, Mr. G——— differed,
and, in particular, insisted upon an indemnification
for it, from either France or
Spain. He wanted St. Lucia and Porto Rico,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
or the entire property of Jucatan and Florida.
The Favourite refused to make application
for any of these; upon which Mr. G———
resigned October 12, 1762<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. Mr. Fox (now
Lord Holland) was then called upon to carry
the peace through the House of Commons.
Lord Halifax succeeded to Mr. G———’s office.
But Lord Egremont, being of Mr.
G———’s opinion, prevailed to have an instruction
sent to the D. of B——— to demand
Florida only, which was granted without hesitation;
for the messenger who was dispatched
to the Duke at Paris with this demand,
returned in eight days, with an account
of its having been complied with. The
fact is, the French minister (Choiseul) obliged
the Spanish minister to agree to this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
demand, without sending to his court. A
proof of the discretionary power which was
vested in the French minister by the court of
Spain, to agree to whatever compensation
should be insisted upon for the Havannah.</p>

<p>The following anecdote concerning the
English Ultimatum may throw some light on
the preceding fact:—Towards the latter end
of the negociation, Mr. Wood, then Secretary
to Lord Egremont, called one day at
the Duc de Nivernois’s (the French Ambassador
in London) about three o’clock, and
desired to speak with him. The Swiss told
Mr. Wood, his Excellency was dressing, and
could not be disturbed: but Mr. Wood insisting
upon admittance, was carried up stairs,
and passing through a bed-chamber leading
to the dressing room, he laid some papers
upon the bed, and covered them with his hat.
This circumstance being observed by the
French Secretary, he directly whispered the
Ambassador to keep Mr. Wood to dinner,
and he would copy the papers if they contained
any thing essential. This was accordingly
done: and these very papers, which
contained nothing less than the Ultimatum
on the part of England, were actually copied
by the French Secretary and his clerks, and
dispatched that very night to the Duc de
Choiseul at Paris. Thus the French Minister
at Paris was in possession of these important
papers at least two days before the D.
of B———.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>In a subsequent conference which the D.
of B——— had with the French Minister, he
urged a compliance to his demands in a high
and peremptory tone; the wily French Minister
smiled, and told his G. <i>He knew the
sentiments of the court of London upon the whole
business.</i></p>

<p>It was the current report in England, when
the D. of B——— returned from France, that
he had frequently said to his friends, that he
could have obtained better terms of peace if
he had been permitted. If he was controuled,
why does he not now shew those instances of
controul, and who it was that obliged him
to sacrifice the conquests of the war? As he
is known to keep a diary of all public transactions
wherein he is concerned, there is no
doubt of his being able to give full information;
and as days and dates are sometimes of
importance in affairs of this kind, his diary
will assist him greatly on this occasion. Besides,
his letters are somewhere in existence;
the Chevalier D’Eon never saw them, and
consequently a motion in the H—— of C——
might produce them. We should then see
who were the betrayers of our country in that
infamous peace: And who it was that so frequently
pressed his G. to conclude the negociation,
and sign the treaty. The originals
of all these important letters are still in
being; and if they should not, there is no
doubt the D. has a copy of them in his diary.
I repeat it emphatically, the correspondence
relative to the negociation ought to be laid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
before the public. The Commons of England
have a right to call for it; and it is a
duty which they owe to their country and to
posterity.</p>

<p>Whether the immediate cession of Florida,
or what other cause that has not yet transpired,
encouraged the demand of Porto Rico,
or whether the D. of B. knowing Mr. G——’s
sentiments, made that demand himself, finding
Florida so easily given up; certain it is,
that a demand of that important island was
made; and here the French Minister resorted
to his chicane. A messenger was sent with
this demand to the Court of Madrid. Fourteen
days were allowed for the messenger to
return. During this interval, the D. received
express and positive orders <i>to sign the
treaty immediately</i>. Two days after the treaty
was signed, and within the fourteen days,
the messenger returned from Madrid, with
the surrender of the island. It has been suspected,
perhaps from the complexion of the
fact, that the island was purchased. If it was,
Count V. no doubt, knows both the sum
that was given, and to whom it was consigned.
If any sum actually was given, it
was by Spain; for the view of France was,
to make Spain pay the piper.</p>

<p>My next will contain some further particulars
of this extraordinary negociation.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> In the pamphlet, intituled, <i>An Appendix to the State
of the Nation</i>, we find this fact strongly pointed at, p. 16,
wherein the author says, in reply to the <i>Observer</i>: “If
he means to charge the great statesman (Mr. G.) who
was Secretary of State at the time the plans for the reduction
of Martinique and the Havannah were carried
into execution, with consenting to restore them <i>without
compensation</i>; I must tell him, that it was publicly
spoken of, at the time the treaty of Paris was negociating,
that this gentleman resigned his office of Secretary
of State for no other reason, <i>than that further cessions
in the West Indies were not insisted on</i>.” And in the
Observations on the State of the Nation, we find that
author not unacquainted with this part of the negociation,
though, agreeable to the principles of the party he espouses,
it is but faintly touched; page 29, 8vo edit. are
these words, “If this gentleman’s hero of finance, instead
of flying from the treaty, which, though he now
defends, <i>he could not approve</i>, and would not oppose; if
he, instead of shifting into an office, <i>which removed him
from the manufacture of the treaty</i>,” &amp;c.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="gesperrt">LETTER </span>III.<br>
<span class="smaller">To Dr. MUSGRAVE of <span class="smcap gesperrt">Plymouth</span>.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="gesperrt">SIR</span>,</p>

<p class="dropcap">The article respecting the East-India
Company, is a demonstration that
better terms of peace might have been obtained,
if they had been insisted upon. During
the negociation Mr. Wood waited upon
Mr. Rous, on the subject of an article, including
the Company’s affairs, to be inserted
in the treaty. An article was accordingly
framed, and sent to the ministers, who said
it was impossible to obtain what was therein
demanded. They altered it: and if it had
been permitted to remain with their alterations,
as it had been agreed to by the French
ministers, and as it stood in the preliminaries,
the interests of the Company would
have been essentially injured. But Lord
Clive opposed it; and in consequence of this
opposition, it was altered to the form in
which it now stands in the general treaty.</p>

<p>With regard to the <i>present</i>, or rather <i>new</i>
treaty of commerce, the following is not a
little curious.</p>

<p>When the D. of B. Mr. N——le, and the
Ducs de Choiseul and Praslin were together
at Choiseul’s hotel, at a conference on the
peace, the D. of B. said, he would not renew
the treaty of Commerce that was made at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
Utrecht, because some of the articles had
been objected to by the British parliament.
The subject dropped after a short conversation
upon it: and they proceeded to renew
the treaty of Aix la Chapelle, and other matters.
At length the D. of B. renewed the
subject of the treaty of commerce: upon
which Choiseul said, the treaty of commerce
had never been mentioned during the negociation.
But, answered the D. it has always
been understood. Choiseul replied, you
must either take the treaty of commerce as it
now is, between the two nations (meaning
that which was offered to be renewed) or
there must be no treaty of commerce at all.
The D. of B. declared, he would not accept
of that treaty; nor would he sign the treaty
of peace unless a treaty of commerce was previously
agreed to. And so, says Choiseul,
you want to carve that treaty just as you
please; to put in some articles, and to strike
out others—<i>No!</i> said he in an exclamation,
and turning about to a picture of the French
King, which hung up in the room, and
clasping his hands together, cried out, <i>My
dear master! when I sacrifice your honour, take
off my head</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. N——le then said, Mons. Choiseul,
what better would you be if that treaty was
renewed? The British parliament would disapprove
of it, and the D. of B. would be
impeached for it.—Think you so, said Choiseul?—Yes,
answered the D. of B. and added,
if you do not consent to the making a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
new treaty of commerce, I will return to
England to-morrow morning, and tell the
K. there is no honour in the French ministry;
that he must send for Mr. <span class="smcap">Pitt</span>, who
is the only man to deal with them, and renew
the war. The name of <i>Pitt</i> frightened the
French minister; he gave up the contest.
A treaty of commerce was made; but has
not been published, nor was it laid before
parliament.</p>

<p>During the negociation, the Duc de Choiseul
was constantly complaining of the English
news-papers; which, he said, were continually
publishing the terms of the peace;
and these papers coming into France, he added,
induced the French to think, and say, he was
sacrificing the interest of France in that treaty;
which he apprehended might occasion some
enthusiast to assassinate him. In complaisance
to him, and to quiet his fears on that
head, it was, that no authentic defence or even
authentic account of the negociation and
treaty, was ever published.</p>
